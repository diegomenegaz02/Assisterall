# Assisterall
This is for my personal assistant and replacement for a medical fix. 
Essentially I'm making this to learn web development in a fun, functional way that might actually assist me daily.
Learning Goals:
Create and implement Function Requirements
Maintain and Debug Production.
Learn and Understand Web Development by slowly adding more and more uneeded stuff until my brain explodes.
Yes I am coding, Yes I am having fun(its a lie for hiring managers, this is all for you <3)
(Fun Note Recession is starting today apparently yay)
